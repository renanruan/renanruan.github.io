        description:"<p>This project is a desktop application for Windows designed to interface with highway radar systems. It was one of my first ventures into working with third-party devices, specifically radar systems, and was instrumental in deepening my understanding of industry practices, collaboration with other companies, and integration of external systems.</p><p>The application features a graphical user interface and supports communication via TCP, UDP, and serial protocols with local radar systems. It enables users to configure radar settings (such as speed limits and sampling intervals), monitor activities (including logs of recent vehicles and their speeds), and record data in text format. Additionally, it supports network configuration to ensure smooth operation.</p><p>For this project, I employed C# for programming, Visual Studio as the integrated development environment, and Windows Forms (WForms) for the user interface. The use of communication protocols like TCP, UDP, and serial facilitated reliable data transmission and effective interaction with radar systems.</p>",
