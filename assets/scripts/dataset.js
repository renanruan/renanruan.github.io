        date:"Jun 2024", 
        description:"<p>This project explores the use of machine learning to classify significant alterations in the spatial gradient, a phenomenon impacting satellite communication, by analyzing ionosphere data and satellite positions. The study focuses on ionospheric events, particularly Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPB), and evaluates attributes such as Scintillation, Equatorial Plasma Bubbles, and Satellite Relative Position to determine their effect on the Spatial Gradient. Key parameters, including HANTS values, are used to indicate the occurrence of these phenomena.</p><p>I utilized several advanced technologies for data analysis and modeling. Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Sliding Window method was employed for classification, leveraging pattern recognition with a temporal dimension. Linear Regression with a Sliding Window method was used for regression, estimating values based on a set of training examples. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), ideal for sequential and temporal data, were applied for deep learning, capturing temporal dependencies through hidden states.</p><p>The models were developed on the Google Colab platform using Python, which offers powerful computational resources, including GPUs and TPUs, and easy integration with Google Drive for data storage. Python's extensive libraries and frameworks, such as TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, and Pandas, provided essential tools for data manipulation, modeling, and algorithm evaluation.</p><p>The developed models exhibit a promising ability to identify and predict significant ionospheric changes, potentially enhancing the safety and efficiency of air navigation and satellite communication. The practical application of these findings can directly benefit GNSS-based navigation systems by providing more accurate and adaptive tools for early detection of adverse ionospheric conditions, thereby increasing the reliability of global positioning systems and contributing to better airspace management and flight safety.</p>",
